# SidTorch
This is a personal project where I implement a bunch of simple neural network things from scratch using prior knowledge, intuition, and papers :).

## TODO
- Implement my own numpy version (SidPy?)
    - there's a lot of literature in optimizing matrix multiplication that I don't understand which I think would be cool to investigate
- Activation layer support
- Kolmogorov Arnold networks
- Spiking Neural Networks
- Transformers. MHA
